------Changes from V1.1------
TODO :
-Add Moteino Reset Button
-Review if we need 2 capcaitors when 2 devices are so close to each others
DONE :
-Reverse C4 (-5V)
-Adjust Holes (remove center, increase clearance at the back to let room for the screwdriver in front of heat sink
-Added Test Pin for 4.096V (Near DAC)
-Replace Load Connector for more current AK500 ?
-Bigger footprint for D3
-Biaise A0, A1, A2 from MCP23008 to ground
-Remove Serial Connector (replaced by pinhead on the moteino itself)
-Wirewound resistors Size 2010->.530 .217
-R7 & R16 Should connect to high current at the same place and as close as possible from R17 (avoid impact of resisitivity of high current trace)
-Improve resistance of high current tracks
-Remove R Divider for LM35 as 10mV/°C would lead to 330°C at 3.3V
-Invert GND VCC on Trigger's Schmitt
-Actua PWM (4 Pins) Fan (12V with 5V PWM)
-Better marking power supply +/-
-Battery for RTC or BAT Pin to Ground
-Connect MFP Pin of the RTC
-Change test point for test loop
REJECTED
-Make it easier to mount pin for moteino (RST @ UART GND)


------Changes from V1.2------
TODO
DONE
* Removed MCP23008
* Expose SPI on front panel to connect SPI LCD
* -> Moteino Mega
* Replace connectors to control panel with one single 16 pin connector

------Changes from V1.3------
TODO
* Do we need schmitt triggers on Front Panel ?
* Review connectors to VSens on DIspatch Board
DONE
* All TO220 should be aligne on the edge of the board
* SMD Quartz for RTC
* Add extra connector to PowerSupply to distribute power to other boards (Extra JST or Screw Terminal)
* Add 5V to FrontPanel (Relay)
* PCB for Encoder + JST5 to Front Panel Control
* SPI on Fron Panel Control
* Add I2C Connector to FrontPanel
* optimize Fan Conector for 4Wires (On/Off 12V PS + 5V PWM)

------Changes from V1.4------
TODO


DONE
* Fixed push button with led connection
* Revert Electrolytic Capacitor C2 on Dispatch (Relay control)
* Inverse Inline / Extern labels on DIsplatch (Green shoudl be extern)
* Replace Pin Header by JST for SPI Screen on Dispatch
* Added two ground test probes
* Enlarged holes for Rotary Encoder side pins
* Hole down to 2.8 for ELBoard, Dispatcher, PS and Buttons
* Smaller Cap on PS (Down to 470µ)
* Invert Trigger input Diode
* Added 5V/12V test probes to main board
* Connected D13, A2, A4 to FrontPannel Connectror
* PS - LM SHoudl be on the same side to be able to attach them to back panel's heat sink
* Add VSense connector to Trigger PCB

------Changes from V1.5------
TODO
* Add Ethernet to the board
* Remove OnStart LoadOff SubCircuit
